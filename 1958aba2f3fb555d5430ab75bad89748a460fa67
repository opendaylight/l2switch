      "message": "It is defined here because this pom does not have a logical parent (i.e. no \"parent\" tag). So we would have to change this pom\u0027s parent structure if we wanted to define it somewhere else at which point we should really consider moving the SCM, repositories and other tags.\n\nI think there needs to be a push post helium to come and clean up the logical pom /parent structures for all projects which can help to consolidate  and prevent this type of confusion",
